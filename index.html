            Go on a journey with Rick Pels, a passionate guardian of Amsterdam's Zoutkeetsgracht in the idyllic district of 
            Westelijke Eilanden. Here, his spirit meets the water's pollution, a solo mission for cleaner, clear canals.

        <p>
            In the heart of Westelijke Eilanden, Zoutkeetsgracht, Rick Pels has taken it upon himself to be the 
            defender of the cute canals that give the character to the Westelijke Eilanden its allure. His love for shipfaring makes this a somewhat 
            easier task to complete in his own accord. But he might need the help of you! The kind volunteers.

            Be part of a compelling story of the one-man-army Rick Pels, trying to make an impact on the cleanliness of Westelijke Eilanden. 
            Sadly Rick cant do it all on his own, he needs help and so does the Zoutkeetsgracht. We must preserve the beauty of this precious canal!
